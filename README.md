Limbo YouTube features a property editor for inserting (via URL or embed code) a YouTube video. The property editor saves a bit of information about the video, which then will be availble in C#.

The current version [**v2**](./v2) supports Umbraco 10 and 11, while the past version [**v1**](./v1) supports Umbraco 9.
